# NvChad Config 
by Gambhir Sharma

Put this code inside you `~/.config/NvChad/lua/custom/` folder 

> Note: I forget to keep track of my config in NeoVim and accidently deleted all my config. This is the last config file I have with me it's not completed. I Migreated to Lazy vim so will share the new config in future.
